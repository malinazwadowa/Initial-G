/*
 * - 
 * - weapon projectiles have unesscary refference to prefab and other data, get what is needed for projectile no more and pass it as spear properties, in  weapon script itself we can refer to current rank data ?
 *       - the naming Properties sucks, think of better one. its related to projectile/collision/impact 
   >>>> kinda fixed.. but still dont like it that much. projectiles only get what they need but WeaponProperties is still in use name makes sense

 * - 
 * - check if preloading enemydata for pooler works
