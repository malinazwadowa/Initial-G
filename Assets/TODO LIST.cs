/*
 * - Pooler KEY changed, update all despawn object calls and the method arguments itself.
 * - wepon projectiles have unesscary refference to prefab and other data, get what is needed for projectile no more and pass it as spear properties, in  weapon script itself we can refer to current rank data ?
 *       - the naming Properties sucks, think of better one. its related to projectile/collision/impact 
 * - enemydata has reference to enemy prefab xD no need for that anymore
 * - check if preloading enemydata for pooler works
 * -
